Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share thoughts, tips, and notes — mostly about Azure and related topics.

Writing isn’t my strongest suit (I prefer doing over writing), so don’t expect fancy blogs or long essays here. These articles are mostly quick notes or summaries based on real-world work and experiences. Hopefully, you'll still find something useful!

🔧 Main Topics
Microsoft Azure

Azure DevOps

Cloud tips from the field

Occasional PowerShell scripts and automation

📌 Why I Write
I believe even a small note can help someone else — or future me — save time. These articles are my way of giving back while keeping things casual and simple.

🙏 Note
I'm not aiming for perfection here. These are raw, real, and to the point. Feedback is welcome, just be kind 😉

Let me know if you want to add links, a table of contents, or anything else!
