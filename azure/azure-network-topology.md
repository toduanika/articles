# Azure Network Topology

## What is Network Topology?

Network topology defines how various devices or locations are interconnected. There are several types of topologies, including Point-to-Point, Bus, Ring, Star, Tree, and Mesh.

Since our topic is Azure, and the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) primarily focuses on the Hub-and-Spoke model when discussing topologies, our main focus will be on the Star topology, commonly known as Hub-and-Spoke in Azure.

## Why is it crucial to choose the right topology?

Selecting the right network topology is essential because it impacts performance, scalability, reliability, and cost-efficiency. A well-designed topology ensures smooth data flow, minimizes downtime, and reduces long-term expenses for setup and maintenance.

## Options in Azure

- Traditional Azure Networking Topology
- Virtual WAN Network Topology

***Traditional Azure Networking Topology***

In a traditional Network Topology in Azure, one Virtual Network serves as the Hub, while all other Virtual Networks, used as landing zones, are connected to it as Spokes.

Pros:

- The custom Virtual Network provides flexibility to manage subnets within the Hub and add multiple IP address prefixes to the virtual network.
- It is possible to integrate various resources into the Virtual Network (such as Virtual Machines, Azure Bastion, Private DNS Resolver, and Azure Application Gateway).
- The Virtual Network does not have a built-in router, meaning there are no bandwidth limitations unless we implement a third-party Network Virtual Appliance. (For the Azure Firewall Premium SKU, we can increase bandwidth up to 100 Gbps)

Cons:

- Complicated routing capabilities.
- To achieve transit connectivity between Virtual Networks, we need to integrate a VPN Gateway, Azure Firewall, or a third-party Network Virtual Appliance in the Hub.

***Virtual WAN network topology***

Azure Offers manage hub and spoke solution in the resource Virtual WAN, where the central connectivity point is Virtual Hub and spoke Virtual Networks are connected to it.

Pros:

- Easy to manage since everything is combined within the Virtual WAN resource.
Simplified routing capabilities.
- Azure Virtual WAN's built-in gateways offer higher bandwidth than traditional Virtual Network Gateways. It also allows using Azure Virtual WAN for more than 100 S2S tunnels.
- Azure provides the ability to easily integrate third-party NVAs into the virtual hub, which is particularly useful if you already have existing SD-WAN solutions for interconnecting different locations.
- The Route Maps feature is available only in Virtual WAN. This feature allows summarizing, controlling, and managing routes from on-premises and Virtual Networks. It also enables modifying BGP attributes such as AS-PATH to make a route more or less preferable.

Cons:

- The spoke Virtual Network cannot contain any type of Gateway.
- Each hub has the same BGP AS Number, which can be problematic for some redundancy scenarios.
- DDoS Protection Standard cannot be used, as it is not possible to activate it in the hub.
- Private DNS Zones cannot be linked to the virtual hub; you need to create a spoke Virtual Network for DNS.
- Azure resources such as Application Gateway and Azure Bastion cannot be directly integrated into the virtual hub; instead, you must set up a spoke Virtual Network for them.

Note: Using new resources called Azure Virtual Network Manager we also can to set up mesh network topology. We can't use this resource with Virtual WAN resource.

### Conclusion

A traditional Virtual Network as a Hub provides greater flexibility, especially if you have strong networking skills. With this approach, you can implement various routing scenarios.
The Virtual WAN resource is particularly useful for multi-region setups, especially if you already have an on-premises SD-WAN solution. It allows you to easily extend your Cloud Network Infrastructure as an SD-WAN branch.
Choosing the right topology is a personal decision and should be designed to meet your specific needs. You can consider my personal thoughts, but itâ€™s always better to test everything thoroughly before deploying it in production.
This article was written on November 22, 2024, so new features might be available for both options by now.
